# Analysis of Semi-Supervised Learning and Data augmentation Techniques 

Implemented a semi-supervised learning algorithms using convolutional neural networks. 

Experiment with the following semi-supervised learning algorithms, Entropy Minimization and MixUp. Conducted experiments with the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The following are the experiments that were conducted.
1) Implement a deep convolutional neural network using only the labeled training data and report its performance on the test data. (Baseline) 
2) Apply Entropy Minimization for unlabeled data along with labeled data to train a semisupervised learning model and report the performance on the test set. 
3) Apply data augmentation technique MixUp on the training data and report the performance on the test set. 
4) Apply all of the above semi-supervised learning techniques on the training data and report the performance on the test data. 
5) Conduct experiments by varying the number of labeled and unlabeled samples.
